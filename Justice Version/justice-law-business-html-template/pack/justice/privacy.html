This information is used for administrative purposes and to improve your experience with our Web sites. For example, this information helps authenticate you (i.e. verify that you are who you say you are), an essential component of site security. Cookies also make it easier for you to navigate a Primex Web site by, among other things, "remembering" your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you move between pages or services. You can set your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or to prevent cookies from being set. However, if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality, and declining to use authentication related cookies will prevent you from using the Web site altogether. </p>

We have offices and operations throughout the United States, but are primarily located in the Northeast with our largest offices in New York and New Jersey. Each PMMX office maintains its own business continuation plan that provides for alternative operating sites, back-up facilities and systems. </p>

Because PMMX conducts its business activities from multiple locations, it has made arrangements to relocate associates to one of several backup locations in the event that a primary work location is unavailable. In the following sections A – C, we describe how our Business Continuity Plan will be deployed in a variety of potential business disruption scenarios. </p>

Other associates may be directed to one of several alternate sites, which are designed to be operational within 48 hours after a disruptive event. And in some cases, associates can work from home. Essential information systems and data are similarly restored and made available thanks to regularly tested backup and recovery procedures. </p>

In the event one or more backup sites are unavailable, impacted associates would utilize an alternate site outside the business district or city, or in some cases, they may work from home. For example, associates from PMMX’ main office in New York may be directed to one of several other proprietary or third party locations in New York, New Jersey or other states, depending on availability. Our goal is to provide critical personnel an operational backup site within 24 hours, and other associates within 48 hours. </p>

In the event no designated site is available due to a large-scale disruptive event, it may be necessary for PMMX to suspend its operations until alternate arrangements can be made. As discussed in PMMX’ Business Continuity Plan, PMMX will maintain communications with and assist its customers and business partners to the best of its ability in the circumstances. While we strive to restore our operations within 24 to 48 hours, our actual recovery time will depend on the nature and extent of the business disruption.  </p>
